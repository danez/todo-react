# Todo App in React

A simple typescript todo react app.

## Getting Started
To use the starer:

1. [Fork your own copy of the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) and clone your copy:
  ```bash
  > git clone git@github.com:[Your User Id]/webpack-react-typescript-starter.git
  ```
2. Install the dependencies
  ```bash
  > npm install
  ```
3. Boot up dev server
  ```bash
  > npm start
  ```
4. Edit your code (configured well for [vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/))
5. Build production:
  ```bash
  > npm build
  ```
6. You can optionally host the production build by running
```bash
> npm run live-server
```
7. You can then host your results [on github as a static page](https://pages.github.com/).
